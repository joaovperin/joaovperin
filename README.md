### Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

My first name is JoÃ£o Victor, but everyone call me only Perin.<br/><br/>
I'm a Java backend developer that uses a lot of Spring and JPA, but my passion is about creating generic and reusable code to help other programmers life.

I do some frontend too, with some Flutter, Angular and Android/Java experience.

My passion for now is Flutter, and I'm currently studying the creation of maintanable multiplatform applications using this beautiful framework.

- âœ¨ I develop since 2018
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Makish for [Web](https://makish-app.web.app) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.makish)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter and Rust (in free time)
